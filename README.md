# Next.js Calculator

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

The calculator implements three common programming challenges:

### Factorial Calculator
Calculates the factorial of a number (n!), which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
- Example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- Input restrictions: Only non-negative integers
- Implementation: Uses recursive approach

### Fibonacci Sequence
Generates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
- Input restrictions: Only positive integers
- Implementation: Uses iterative approach for better performance

### FizzBuzz
A classic programming problem that prints different outputs based on number divisibility.
- Returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- Returns "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
- Returns "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
- Returns the number itself if none of the above conditions are met
